# Realtor-Database
A term project from my third year in UBC. Made in collaboration with Maylisa Siem and Harrison Liu.

### *Overview* 

<p> Realtor Database is a simulator for a database made for realtors, sellers, and buyers. It allows members to register
as one of the three aforementioned options, then proceed to each of their respective home pages. From each home page, users
can view, add, or edit properties, manage clients, and perfrom various queries through the interface.

Project access: https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~aquon01/homepage.php
*code is connected to each contributor's MySQL account, and so queries may return no results*
